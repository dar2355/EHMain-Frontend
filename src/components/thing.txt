The Beginner’s Guide

Speaking of I realized earlier that i can actually tell when i'm horny now but it's not this incessant urge.  .—.
It was rare that I ever could before lol. It never really came to mind o3o

	Brilliant. 

	This was a good game. A great game. Well…was it a game? I’m still not totally sure, but I do suppose it does indeed qualify as one. I interact with it, and have a virtual space to move in. It is a game. 

	It felt a lot like a poem in a way. Something that I could analyze and interpret freely almost. As I progressed through the game, I saw something in it emerge and then dissipate. What was the point? I gave it one. 
￼

	Honestly, I’m considering the possibility of sharing this game with my english teachers lol. I wonder what they’d think of it. Would they see it the same way? 

	I connected with it. I felt a lot of the same things. I still do sometimes, to be honest. It was…interesting, to put it simply. Unique. It was an experience. I felt as though I were walking through my own dreams, my own mind, and formed something form it. It sparked older memories, but also many various truths as well. I liked exploring “your” interpretation of events and things that happened as well. 

	you did it. You did create a game from something: a compilation of “nothings” that were ever-so-slightly modified- to tell a story that unfolded right in front of me. I felt like I was in it. Immersed entirely. I saw deep evolution and emergence of character, and it just resonated. Echoed. 

	I heard that most said this has a playtime of about an hour and a half. Not me. Ohhh, no. I took the challenge of really interpreting it - all that I could. I began to push my mind a bit here and there to try and come up with something. But of course, that was both the point and the counterpoint too. Beautiful.

	I wrote down every little thing that I thought about. As the game went on, I thought more and more. The playtime became a matter of days instead of just hours - each of which I enjoyed throughly.

	Here are the exact words of yours just to be on the safe-side. I don’t know how much you get spammed or if ya get annoyed every time ya open something like this lol:
- “If you have a particular interpretation that I haven’t mentioned here, or you just need to get in touch, you can E-mail me at DAVEYWREDEN@GMAIL.COM”

	You might’ve heard or seen a similar interpretation before, but I just wanted to get in-touch and at the end of it all, say thanks. 

	Below is my journal of sorts - everything that I thought or saw or thought about as I played along. At first it’s mmm…a little shallow. There aren’t nearly as many things that I thought about completely or wrote down as not to miss, but it definitely expands with the later chapters. If you want, take a look. It could provide feedback or something.

Thanks again!

————————————————————————————————————————— 

* Ch. 0: A map
    * This appears to just be a testing ground for his creative mind. He experiments and sees what he can do, deliberately placing blocks in various places. It’s unique - there’s a blob here, a matte green box there among regularly-textured figures. They all have collision.
    * It is apparently his first game.

* Whisper machine - needs to be turned off. Perhaps schiz?
    * engine room.
    * need to give yourself up for it to turn it off
        * Originally bugged so that beam doesn’t kill
        * Instead you rise into infinity - touch the heavens through the roof
        * Feels… human
        * Inspired to do more experimental designs - something lodges in his head that day.
* The past was behind her
    * Starts surrounded by brick walls. Feels like a dream. On the wall behind you states “The past was behind her.”
    * In this game you can only walk backwards
    * “Why does the future keep changing”
        * Walls change and move differently as progress is made
    * “It becomes clearer when she stops and looks”
        * presented with change in scenery - chrome-silver-looking steps 
    * “But the future is always behind her - how can she find the strength”
        * Setting changes, it does look futuristic
    * “…to confront it”
        * Door at top of steps disappears revealing that final message before the ‘game’ (narrative, play; interactive poem) ends

Games appear to be art - like poetry or music - that convey a powerful message full of deeper thought. I swear I could’ve heard the slightest change in his tone. Perhaps this creator person… chad, was it(?) (it’s Cuda), “goes away” 

* Ch. 3: Entering (Nov 2008)
    * Starts off surrounded by darkness. Cobble path, wooded night, forest. 
    * One can hear crickets and atmospheric noises. 
    * Darkness is fully opaque - there is no way to see what is ahead, one can merely think back to what they’ve seen. The past is their map.
        * Maybe i’m thinking too deep, we’ll see.
    * It is impossible to go off this path from the start, and one cannot go behind
    * First sign is “You are now entering” without a name
    * Meaning is not clear just yet (supposedly) - narrator asks to bear with him to see what makes it interesting

* Ch. 4: Stairs (Dec 2008)
    * “nonsense in every direction”
    * Cuda would only stop talk to narrator about the game as he was making it - when he finished: that was it. The game was done.
    * 3 large rectangular prisims, I believe they represent buildings in a city. They are all grey. There is a light on one up very high, leading to which is a stairway of the same main grey color. There are no walls around this place. I will check if one may jump.
        * Answer is no. There is also nothing surrounding the buildings - the narrator makes a comment on this as well. 
        * I suppose you can tell a lot about a person from the way they approach abstract games such as this one as well.
    * There is a sound in the atmosphere - sounds like … strange, whispering moan.
    * You slow as you go up these stairs. You speed up as you go down.
    * The door at the top opens as you slow to a crawl. Narrator presents the question: “Why does it open” 
        * Modifies the game so that when enter is pressed, one gets back up to full speed so that the gamer may see what’s at the top. 
    * If you jump continuously you’ll gain a bit of speed. However, doing this multiple times will eventually start to push you back down the steps.
        * i will not use the enter button. I will play it as it is meant. Well - at least by what’s normally bounded by the game’s laws. Jumping does increase speed, btw, just slightly.
        * One still may not jump off upon reaching the top. The narrator says nothing if enter is not used.
    * This room is one that is warm, nice, and filled with “ideas for games.”
        * Interesting
    * “It can be a very slow climb to see that coda is actually a kind and compassionate person.”
        * a game that comes with a manual giving you incorrect instructions on how to play.
        * Whisked away before I can truly see them all. (aww)

* Ch. 5: Puzzle (Jan 2009)
    * “Ready, Set, Fish”
    * I feel as if i’m in a…something. Like some sort of exhibit at a zoo. That’s what it sounds like anyway. I can picture it well around, as if i’m just underground.
    * I come to a ledge with a door within it. It is too high to climb back up. I go back to check and see things but nothing is different. I’ll still continue to do this in every game though. 
    * This puzzle consists of a lever and a door.
    * When the lever is triggered the door opens, revealing a room with another door. Before this door lies a very short connecting hallway that’s totally black with black fog.
        * Ominous.
    * there is nothing that stops me from flipping the switch when i am in the doorway. Like sliding doors it detects my presence and goes back. I stand here in between two rooms. The door on the dark side does not open just yet. One is light and guaranteed to be safe - but i cannot move from it. On the other there is darkness and a closed door. There is nothing beckoning me one way or the other, so I progress.
    * Upon going into the dark room with the closed door, there is a switch upon the closed door. It phases through the wall, previously invisible. Flipping the switch opens the door in the darkness, revealing a cozy wooden room. 
        * “Don’t forget that solution because we’re going to…see it a lot…”
        * tone changed there too i think. Just towards the end.
    * I come to another drop off-off point beyond the wooded area. The floor is stone again
    * I go through it and into a room - the door closes behind me. 
        * Game is now modified so that when enter is pressed, all the walls in the room are removed.
        * I predict that there will be reflections of choices or alternate routes i could’ve taken. I imagine that this was inspired by the original rising glitch.
        * turns out he decided to press enter for me cuz there was no way to do it. Technically, i just clicked but ok lol.
    * All around appear to be different paths. Are they procedural?
    * I paused the game to take notes aaaand it crashed :P 
    * HOLD ON A TIC - i just realized i solved the puzzle on accident xD
        * interesting
    * In this game, a dull interior concealed a highly active exterior. “It contrasts with the previous game, stairs”
    * “Most of the time, you don’t get to know what you’re missing.”
        * And yet somehow, I called it in my mind - or at least something of the sort. Interesting.

* Ch. 6: Exiting (Jan 2009)
    * Dark path again. Same as before. Same rules, Physics, etc.
    * I come across a sign that says “You Are Now Exiting”
    * “It tells us that Coda believes his games are connected somehow”
    * “There is a bigger picture that we cannot see until we played all of the games - then we step back to see what that bigger picture is”

* Ch. 7: Down (March 2009)
    * “The Great and Lovely Descent”
    * I spawn in a room full of white. There is nothing around except for a cozy-looking brick house. All around are these hills that curve and slant upwards. To get to this home we must climb down to the center.
    * Narrator explains what an engine is - 
        * “An engine is a set of tools for game development. It determines what the game can and can’t do”
        * “Coda uses a game engine called ‘Source.’ It has a set of things it does well and a set of things it does poorly”
        * “Something it does well is boxy linear corridors. Coda is working with what the engine does well”
            * Here i presume he is working with what the engine does not do well.
            * I notice at this point the title of the home. It appears to be a restaurant instead. It is called “The Streetwise Fool”
        * “Take note of the art style/architecture - comes from something that is very good at producing linear boxy corridors.”
    * I enter and upon approaching it, a door opens. In that door is a staircase leading down and another corridor. I’ll try to reach that corridor by jumping to it, but it looks slightly too-far away
        * Turns out it isn’t, the only thing that happened was a new bit of music started to play.
    * I descend the white stairs and come to an endless empty space where everything is suspended, floating. I can see things all around. It is a parkour-like area. I’ll test my skill.I look up and just see black. There is no turning back when i try to parkour.
    * Main colors are white, grey and orange
    * I come to a fork. Slanted white block or more grey boxes. Boxes.
    * I fall. That was a hard jump. But it seems ok. The void around me was slanted - pushed me towards another circular spiral staircase. It appears that Cuda was experimenting with what he “Couldn’t” do.
    * Cylinder in the middle with a light is invisible, yet has collision.
    * I approach the room that opens and see another room. I get closer and the sound of a metal gate plays. A gate appears behind me out of nowhere when i enter.
    * I hear a monitor of some sort
        * Am I in a hospital? Maybe a prison?
    * One gate suddenly opens and I can go into one of the cells. As I get closer to the…bars within it, a light flickers on. The game lags a little lol. The gate does not close until I go inside.
    * I appear to be set on an elevator. It takes me up. The gate into darkness opens. I shall explore this floor first. …oorrrr, maybe i won’t because the game won’t allow it. I walk in and the gate shuts as my camera is turned around.
        * “This prison originally stayed shut for a full hour before letting you go”
        * “If ya don’t mind i think we’re gonna skip that”
            * yeah…thanks lol.
            * His mind is the prison. Where he thinks.
    * Narrator and Coda got into arguments - “If all this time goes into a game, why not make it playable?” 
        * “after one of these arguments, Coda went home and sent me a zip file titled ‘playable games.’ It contained hundreds of individual files where one could just walk around within a box, and that was it.”
        * “Believe me, I played every single one of those games just to see if there was a gag hidden somewhere… There wasn’t.”
    * I come down some steps into a room It is ‘spherical’ 
    * There are more cells that are inaccessible on the sides and a spiral staircase that goes down more. Within this “transparent” cylinder, is a hanging light. The first was in the floor.
    * Suddenly, we are outside, with a clear, bright, beautiful blue sky on what appear to be grassy prison grounds.
    * I do not see a trace of the rest of the prison anywhere. It looks so small from the outside.
    * Come to a puzzle - with the same solution as the last one.
        * But i’ll still experiment a little…
        * The same puzzle. Same room, same situation - perhaps the shadowy corridor is slightly longer though.
        * Nothing has changed on the outside. Time to move on.
        * “I’ll share with you my interpretation [of this puzzle] shortly”
        * I manage to get through he puzzle while closing the exit door behind me. Perhaps it does something?
    * I come down a corridor and into another room. There are people. Instead of heads they all have green heads with “Listen” on them. They are all sitting
        * “He uses some sort of dialogue system that he fashioned using the engine’s chat capability.
    * I am being interviewed by these three men. I am given a choice of one of 3 answers. They are all correct. Behind me is a furnace. The lighting on this furnace is a bit buggy.
    * “Now this is important. Did you have to get through a puzzle with two doors and switches?”
        * 1. Yes I did. That was literally the last thing I did before I got here.
        * 2. No, I don’t remember having to go through any puzzle
        * 3. I’d prefer not to tell you. After all, we’ve only just met.
    * I’m going to choose option number 1. It is the most honest.
    * “Again, Perfect! Now please tell us how you solved it”
        * 1. I…I don’t remember how I solved it. I’m trying to but i can’t…
        * 2. I didn’t solve it, someone else let me in
        * 3. Trust me…you don’t want to go over there
    * Here I am presented with these options. I remember perfectly. I did solve it myself. …The third option seems…the best? I want to choose between 1 or 3. i’ll pick 4 and see what happens.
    * Nothing happens if you don’t choose any of the given numbers lol. I guess i’ll go with…It wasn’t too bad. Going there is OK, though you’ll reach a point where things will not progress at all. I will choose number 3. Again, most honest.
    * “There must be an ending. Don’t you understand? We must see it. We need to escape this prison.”
    * The dialogue ends.
    * Another door opens. I pass through it. The wall becomes solid behind me as I watch.
    * I am taken to the room with the same 3 men. I am asked if I solved a puzzle. I’ll say yes, with an offer to learn how to solve it.
        * “No no, we actually find the black space between the two doors much more interesting. Have you seen it yet?”
            * 1. Why would I care about a space between doors?
            * 2. Actually now that you mention it I feel strange as i passed through it.
            * 3. I don’t recall a space between doors.
        * I choose 2.
        * “Don’t think too hard about it. You’ll see it again soon”
        * o.0
    * door opens in same position as before.
    * Spiral staircase, wall closes behind me like before.
    * This staircase is different. The cylinder is big and opaque. I cannot see through it or what comes next exactly.
    * We come to a place outside. It reminds me of a campus. 
    * There is a lamppost.
        * “For some reason Coda fixates on this lamppost. It’s going to appear at the end of every single game from now on”
        * “Up to this point every single one of the games has been abstract. One can only stay in that headspace for so long. Now he wants something to hold onto - a reference point. He wants a destination! And that’s what this lamppost is - a destination.”
        * “His games are going to become a lot more cohesive, and as we go his games will become clearer, and clearer, and clearer…”

* Ch. 8: (April 2009)
    * “This game is connected to the internet.”
    * “As you walk around, you can leave notes”
    * “All notes you see are left by other players”
    * I appear in a room. I see a floating, glowing hexagonal shape. I assume that this is a note.
        * Note 1: “Nice Room. Not.”
        * Now immediately, I can tell that this isn’t really connected to the internet as it suggests. It’s likely what Coda believes the internet would say based on what he has seen or felt before. To him, it is the internet - or at least the words.
    * First game of Coda’s that narrator has ever played.
    * Right off the bat it was “so different from what anyone else was doing” so he was like “I HAVE to be friends with this person”
    * “I was maybe a bit too pushy trying to get his attention… I was overenthusiastic”
        * Note 2: “How do you beat this game?”
        * Coda is quite self aware
        * Note 3: “No point to this”
        * i think i called it lol
    * “Was very gracious with me”
    * I emerge into a very spacious zone. I feel as if I am in space. There are these notes scattered everywhere. Rocky paths line the place.
        * Note 4: “Woah. Holy Shit”
        * yep.
    * Notes turn grey if you already seen them
        * Note 5: “Can u guys hear me?”
        * Note 6: “Hello”
            * “Feel free to skip over all these notes if you don’t feel like reading them. To me they convey a sense of loneliness”
        * Note 7: “Reasonable.”
            * “They’re a way for someone who has all these voices and thoughts to express them in a game that wasn’t meant to be played”
            * “It’s ironic how much better we know this person just through the games they mad. ”
        * Note 8: Everyone read this
        * Note 9: Heyyyyyyyyy
            * “It appeals to me; this ability to get to know someone better without the nitty-gritty in-person socializing”
        * Note 10: This place makes me sad
            * “I felt as though he were inviting me personally into his world..and then I feel less lonely too”
        * Note 11: I want to tell you a secret. Once UPON a time I did…
        * Note 12: define fun

    * It reminds me of my own diary of sorts - of lonely and lost thoughts. So reflective, so self…deprecating. At times, though it does feel inspired here and there too. 
    * ———————————— ————————— 
    * Before me is another corridor. It is kinda green
        * Note 92: Well, i’m here now
        * Note 93: Yeah we’re ALL here now
        * Note 94: There must be a reason for it though
        * Note 95: His terrible secret, he kept it well
        * Note 96: I beat the game!!
        * Note 97: More room?
    * “The puzzle will appear again. I will then tell you what i think it means.”
    * “Each of these games represents an idea that was all in Coda’s mind at the time that he was making it. The puzzle is a way of closing the door on a previous chapter of his life before moving onto the next one”
        * Note 98: Scared of writing something. Don’t want to feel judged
            * There’s that again.
        * Note 99: Escape…escape…need an escape
        * Note 100: He cut it up and spread it between worlds
        * Note 101: almost there…
        * Note 102: I have seen everything. I have traveled the world. I have never told anyone
        * Note 103: I wish there were notes in the real world
            * Ahh but there are, we just don’t hear them. Some though. Some can feel them. Sense them.
        * Note 104: Become one with the spiraling nonsense
    * At this point I notice i am heading down a spiral into orange. I do wonder what those other notes say, or if I’ll get to see them. So many notes, of “others,” inaccessible to one.
        * Note 105: DOWNWARD. KEEP DIGGING.
    * “after exploring a theme he may find difficult, he can then place this puzzle which he knows the solution, knows exactly how it works, so it gives him a simple mechanism for moving on.”
            * Interesting. Something of note is one cannot close both doors unless they look behind them while stepping into the “future.” “I’m trying to remember but I just can’t…” they [the responses] suddenly make more sense now. 
            * You must let the door behind you to move onto the next.
                * I know this all-too well.
    * the whispering winds sound more sharp - more eery, as I descend. Is this what his “hell” looks like?
        * Note 106: You close your eyes and wish for it really bad
        * Note 107: Almost at the end!
    * I hear grumbling. I look down at the floor and see white. Just white. I will be unable to see what the rest looks like after all…I think. Perhaps. Maybe, maybe not.
        * Note 108: Does this puzzle have a solution?
        * Note 109: omg i’ve been here for literally an hour wtf do i do
        * Note 110: HALP
        * Note 111: Shit. How do you solve it
            * “I’m trying to remember but I just can’t…” echoes through me.
        * Note 112: This doesn’t make sense. The second door won’t open!
        * Note 113: HALP
    * “Because there’s this dark area between the doors (a space between spaces), before you move on…you get to pause. … just for a moment. A few moments to reflect on and let go of the events that led you here; To step back and connect the pieces together; To grasp at that…elusive bigger picture.” 
        * At this point the narrator does the motion where he’s thinking of sorts - sort of running his hand over his jaw and grabbing it for a moment in thought. You can tell by how his voice morphs ever-so-slightly.
        * ——
        * Note 114: I’m heading back to the start, later guys.
        * Note 115: Guys, it’s not so bad in here
        * Note 116: No solution
        * Note 117: uhh, no answer I think?
        * Note 118: There is no second switch.
    * I open the second door and see a loooooong red corridor. It’s large and wide. I see one note from the start. Perhaps it took Coda awhile to truly grasp this feeling.
    * Upon returning to the door i hear loud clacking. As if something were trying to clammer to get back, to open the door. ಠ_ಠ 
    * I returned to shut the second door too, just to be safe.
        * Note 119: How do you leave notes?
    * Oh turns out it was just the clacking of typewriters. lol. Spooked myself a little there. Thinking … but whether or not too much is questionable. Some say it could be just right, some say not enough, some say a dangerous level. Who knows ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    * The lamppost again. Surrounded by typewriters. I believe this signals Coda’s real job - income. 
    * “Are you there. IT could be anything! I need you! Say something, please! Talk to me, why are you having so much difficulty talking? Speak! Speak! Speak! Speak! Speak!”
        * …from the text in-game. I just got chills reading that. Someone from the outside trying to understand perhaps. Something somehow holding him back. …maybe. The room fades to black as this happens. He feels dead.

* Chapter 9: Escape (May-June 2009)
    * “Ok this one’s tough. It’s gonna just…spin its own wheels for a few minutes. Hand with me.”
    * I am within a room. Immediately i see bars. I am in a prison? The walls are beige. It seems…cozy? Outside there is a well, and grass upon a cliff surrounded by clouds.
    * Turning around I see the rest of the area. I see a couch. A table. A few pictures, which appear to be somewhat generic. A lamp in the corner, off. 
    * The picture is a cool one of a city. it looks kewl. All the windows and reflections - the oranges and yellows contrasting with the sky - the structure of the buildings themselves, pointing themselves upwards and in - directionally. It’s a picture.
    * If i go into the wall I glitch into it a bit. Perhaps…maybe…this was intended? The collision in Coda’s other games was spot-on.
    * No. Never mind. This was intended. completely. Like an earthquake?
    * The door opens. The “bugginess” …stops. Like nothing happened.
    * Never mind. It doesn’t stop at all. It keeps happening while i remain in the room…
    * …I swear the well has gotten farther away o.o
    * When I am “in” the ground I slow. Perhaps I am crawling.
    * Now entering the door… - wait a sec the lamp is on now. 
    * While I crawl I cannot jump.
        * And now it’s lagging! Interesting! Oh wait no that’s my computer being a butt lol.
    * Hmm. Within the door is a golden-lit staircase. there are yellow-white-gold ring patterns within the wall.
    * Upon getting through i see the city picture on the wall again.
    * I come to the outside I think. Sorta…
    * I step outside and it’s the same texture ground. The wall disappears behind me. Everything vanishes. I’m back to the twilight - between the enter and exit but not exactly within it either.
    * “So like this is it. The whole game. There’s nothing that’s particularly interesting about it. You just walk to the end of this hallway. Except, for some reason Coda gets really fixated on this prison that has all of this modern furniture. And I dunno why, but…he decides he needs to revisit this prison. He’s gonna start over, use the same assets, turn it into something else.”
    * —
    * “OK, cool, here’s version 2”
    * The room is empty. The walls are white. there is no corridor, no hallway, no door, no glitchy colission. 
    * I get to choose what furniture goes in the room
        * 1. How about a TV with sound
        * 2. A refridgerator 
            * misspelled. Interesting. Like I would too lol.
        * 3. Put a giant hole in the ground
        * Well I don’t want things to end just yet but i’m intrigued. I’m going to choose option number 2.
        * and…it’s the glass table from before. Interesting.
    * Now I get to choose what goes along the walls
        * 1. Lets put a huge picture of a horse.
        * 2. I’d really like a washing machine
        * 3. 10 stoves lined up along the wall.
        * More interesting options lol. Hmm…Well, let’s go with a washing machine. Perhaps i’ll revisit the other options another time.
        * Aaaaand, this time I get the chairs
    * Lighting…
        * 1. A skylight. Full-ceiling window. Let’s open this baby up.
        * 2. I’m thinking 10x12 recessed electric 6-in. soft LED ceiling lights with fluorescent trim.
        * 3. We’ll put live tesla coils in each corner. Yeah.
        * …yeah no question here. Number 3 it is lmao
        * LAMP. ’tis back.
    * Now I need a table apparently. I have one though but ok.
        * 1. Who are you? where exactly are you doing this from?
        * 2. I’m pretty sure none of my choices are making any difference.
            * Perhaps playing on the prison aspect of his own mind
        * 3. Tables were invented in 1935. 
        * I’d half expect him to program something for number 2 again. Let’s find out.
        * ಠ_ಠ
    * I get the table. and much much more. The room falls back. There are assets “randomly” Thrown everywhere and on top of each other and within each other. Some things. 
    * “Ehhhh, it’s not really communicating anything. It’s sorta weird for weirdness’ sake”
    * —————
    * “This time he comes at the idea from a different direction”
    * I see all white around me. Ahead of me is a place with a bit of text saying “Hello, please walk forward.”
        * OH GOD IN LOOKIN GAROUND I LOST IT - oh wait nvm there it is.
    * More text: 
        * “This guide will enable you to escape any prison environment”
            * …I remember seeing the idea before somewhere. “A lavish guide/manual that tells you how to play a game wrong”
        * “Follow the instructions carefully. Take care that you remember each step”
    * I come to the room. I am about to be instructed. Inside the room everything seems nice and cozy. The walls are orange. Doesn’t feel all-too prison-like in the traditional sense. Oh wow i think i’ve got it actually. 
    * Coda, I think, uses this as a mechanism to escape his own mind - “remember these instructions carefully” - By going through this process he can divert himself from a thought process any time he wants by following some simple steps. Perhaps
        * 1. Click on this table (glass table on the left)
        * 2. Good. Go over to the photo frame and click to turn it slightly
        * 3. Now turn the floor lamp in this room off, then back on.
            * If i look in a particular direction in line with the lamp the floor textures get buggy. Underneath the cozy wooden surface is untextured grey - it looks much more fitting of a prison.
        * 4. Now go to the left side sofa. Move it over a little.
        * 5. Finally, touch the shelves.
            * Apparently these shelves aren’t what i’m thinking at first. They are actual shelves this time
        * That’s it! In a real prison, escape will now happen. Return to the start to be taken back to your prison.
            * Upon interacting with the items they no longer do anything anymore.
    * There is just a sign on the ground saying “Return”
    * I step on it and return to the “prison” i know
    * “And of course, now the table is gone and you can’t begin the chain of events to escape”
    * ——
    * “Here’s a version where there are no bars, but…you can’t actually get to the well. And then a version where the inside is the outside and the outside is in”
        * I notice here that the narrator is starting to get a bit fast. He wants to tell me what he knows - or wants me to interpret more and more.
    * Taken through a few more prisons
        * One prison is  the bottom of the well
        * One prison has the well replaced by a castle
    * “Personally, I think it’s awful to watch this… to see a person basically…unravelling through their work. I mean at what point do you go ‘ehh maybe there are ideas other than this prison that i could keep working. But…Coda doesn’t have that voice telling you to stop. That particular mechanism of defense against yourself”
        * Overthinking is hard :C
    * “Without it you just…Spiral. So without it you just keep going (x8) until he gets something…and he likes it! And that’s it. He’s done. He stops making prisons”
    * “This is the very last version of the prison game he created…and the reason I think it works is that the prison is not actually in it.”
    * All around me is black. Through a hole i see the lamppost. 
    * As I walk forward I see this hole is just the silhouette of houses upon the night sky.
    * I am in a hedge “maze.” I suspect that this will become a labyrinth later on.
    * Just beyond everything is the lamppost…and too, a booth. A phone booth. I walk around and see nothing too particularly special about it besides the fact that the door opened when i approached. I will now enter.
    * I am teleported inside, i cannot move my camera, and I pick up the phone. Initially, silence. But then…
        * “Hello? Who is this?
            * “Hey! It’s me! I’m you from after you escape the prison!”
        * “You’re me?”
        * “…”
        * “So you were trapped in the prison too?”
    * “It’s a conversation. So this is what Coda wants. To be able to talk to someone, to share what’s on his mind, and to get some good advice from someone who knows. But the irony is even in this scenario, you’re still talking to yourself…”
    * “All of these games so far are Coda talking to himself
            * Provided with 3 answer choices - “Yep! I was in…
            * 1. The furniture maze
            * 2. The escape tutorial
            * 3. the reverse prison
            * Considering this is from the past, I’m going to go with…the escape tutorial.
        * “That’s where i am right now!”
            * nailed it
        * “Oh, i’m so glad to know that I get to get out eventually…”
            * oh…
        * “What’s it like to escape?”
            * 1. Actually, i’m already forgetting what being in the prison was like…
                * …as do I too sometimes, friend-o.
            * 2. It’s strange…but I sort of miss the prison, in a way
                * …
            * 3. It feels like being completely in motion and wildly still at the same time
                * … … … 
            * This thing is getting odd. I remember these feelings. This description matches mine. I’m going with 3. They are all truths to this man.
        * “Do you feel any different?”
        * “Some times i’m scared I’ll get out and then things will be exactly the same as  before”
            * 1. No, I’m really the same person now as I was then.
            * 2. It actually does change. I don’t feel like the same person at all.
            * What would I tell myself? … I am in the same body, spirit, mind as before - yet I do feel completely different. I have learned a lot from staring at the abyss as it stared back. Just staring - never leaping. Only observing.
            * Going with option 2.
        * “Oh good!”
        * “That’s nice to hear.”
        * “That makes me feel…really happy.”
            * 1. Age just kinda does that, you know?
            * 2. I’m still me…but i’m not somehow. It’s hard to describe.
            * 3. Remember to enjoy being who you are right now. It won’t last.
            * All three of these make sense to me. They feel like truths because they are. You only get this one phone call. …let’s use it to give advice. I was going to go with 2, but then 3… 
        * “Wait, if you’re me, then did you get a call from another version of you when you were trapped?
            * 1. No. I think i’m the first person to call back
            * 2. Yes, I did get a call, that’s how I escaped
            * Yet again both are true. For me, I put bits of myself together from others. I learned from them. But…I was the driving force, even if I got low sometimes. I felt something. I’m the first person to call back.
        * “Then can you tell me how to get out?”
        * “Maybe I can come find you!”
        * “What do I have to do?”
            * To get out…
            * 1. All you need to do, is be sincere
            * 2. you need to tell me how you feel right now
            * 3. just talk with me for a bit.
            * going with 3. It leads to the most usually. Gives information while letting stress off. If I show I’m open and trusting, then perhaps he’ll be sincere and come to say how he feels in time.
        * “…what?”
        * “that will free me?”
        * “how does that work?”
            * 1. Listen, you can’t know until you’re out, but I promise it works.
            * 2. Just talk to me
            * 3. It will make sense
            * Perhaps he is having trouble talking with himself - trusting himself. Perhaps he has some empty promises on his own mind. 2 and 3 go together. I’d say the three responses in order, personally. I will choose number 1.
        * “Okay…I can talk”
        * “Let’s just talk for a bit.”
        * “Will you be here?”
            * 1. I will be here for as long as you need
            * Yes.
    * “I can see why he considers this a proper conclusion to the prison games. After all the frustration and obsession…Just to be told by someone you can trust that things are going to be okay…wouldn’t that be nice?”
        * everything is okay in the end. If it’s not okay, it’s not the end.
            * - my favorite quote, by 

* Chapter 10: House (August 2009)
    * “So what would it look like if Coda wanted to make a game about him talking to someone… other than himself.
    * I am placed within a dark cavern. In front of me i see a big hill, upon which there are houses lining the sides. At the top there is the “puzzle” - which was not present in the prison levels. 
    * There is this path. It zig-zags. I’ll stay on it.
    * “To me this environment is meant to represent Coda’s puzzle. With the two doors on either side, and a dark transitional space in between.”
    * I turn around and see that i have emerged from a door. I go back to examine it but there is nothing there.
    * The textures and architecture is great.
    * Upon further inspection as i go forth into light, it is clear that this is not grass, but snow. It is winter. 
    * The trail leads to a house. Inside it is a bed, lamps, rooms — nice cozy fancy house stuff.
    * I am unable to tell if it is dawn or dusk. The wind bellows.
    * I go inside the house. Everything within is warm and inviting. Nice marble table, lights, etc - there is a block-head-figure at the dining room table. It interests me greatly. I will try to explore before interacting with it, however.
    * The howling stops as the door closes behind me. The chimes are claiming. … just like that one note said. Note 47: “Do you hear the chimes? They keep you going, don’t they.”
    * A lovely tune begins playing. On the table in the living room there is some spilled black liquid that I assume is coffee. 
    * — game crashed here — Time is 5:05 am. Going to stop for now.
    * Time 2:58 pm — let’s launch it back up.
    * The sofa has some nice looking pillows. The sofa itself looks welcoming too. Inviting, pointed towards the kitchen, where one of the block-headed NPCs awaits. On his green block-head is the word “Clean”
    * I head into the bedroom and I see a ruffled bed. Stuff is just kinda outta order here. I suppose the NPC wants me to clean it. I’ll interact with it and see what happens.
        * Perhaps Coda feels the need to clean up his thoughts and understand what’s there before he can interact? Or - perhaps he feels the need to talk with “something” first before he can reorganize things and put them back.
    * I cannot interact with anything yet. I’ll speak to the NPC
    * The chat system is much improved, as well as the visuals.
    * “From this point on he puts much more effort into the visuals of his work. So this particular game took 2 months to create, as a result.
    * The NPC is lonely. It was worried it’d need to clean the whole place up itself. It is inviting. “Everyone knows lonesome hands make lousy homes.”
        * 1. Don’t worry about me, a place this nice I’ll be glad to stay here all night.
        * 2. And lousy homes make… home-loners!
        * 3. Are we cleaning this whole place?
        * I choose…2! a bit of humor is always nice to engage.
    * It laughs at the response. Mission accomplished lol
    * It needs me to clean the table.
    * Then make the bed
        * It’s interesting. It’s like coda wants to feel himself applied for someone else? To care and care back?
    * ooo that’s a nice bed. Now Straighten out the rug.
        * “All the little details matter”
        * perfectionism? hmm
    * i am given more options:
        * 1. Do you enjoy being a housecleaner?
        * 2. How’d you end up doing this job?
        * 3. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen a house this messy…
        * Gonna go with 2. I’m curious.
    * “A friend dragged me into it, but i’ve never been so happy doing something for money in my whole life. Never did like cleaning my own home. Might’ve got some demons I ain’t ready to face yet.”
        * A point of relation
    * Straightened the pillows, the mopped up the spilled drink.
    * “I feel compelled to share an incredible cheesy personal insight. You okay with that?”
        * 1. Make it especially cheesy.
        * 2. Yeah I’ll try to get by.
        * 3. Do you absolutely have to?
        * Yeah no question here - going with number 1 lol
    * “… … no… no, it was stupid, sorry. Never mind.”
        * Patience is fine.
        * Asked to wash dishes
    * I wash the dishes
    * Scrub the tub
        * “No need to be perfect. We’re all just human”
    * Organize the books
    * “After the prison, this almost feels like a cleansing. It’s the moment after a particularly difficult or traumatic experience where ya just need to let it sit…and digest inside of you…and eventually, is coherent to something meaningful”
    * Back to the table’s dishes again.
        * 1. Housecleaning is so difficult! How do you do it?
        * 2. Are all houses this easy to clean?
        * 3. Do these chores ever end?
        * Well I may sense a cycle. A pattern because clearing the dishes was the first thing to happen. But this breaks it. … going to go with 2. 
        * “Darling, let me tell you something, you are going to clean a lot of houses in your lifetime. And among all of those, a few of them will stick out as something truly wonderful, beautiful experiences. And none of them will be the ones that were easy. Just something to think about while you smoothen out the rug in the bedroom” 
    * “I know that Coda really liked this game. Of all his work, this one is the only one that he called me up to ask me to come over and look at it. This was over a period of a few months and it looked like he was just…always happy - all the time. Just walked around with a constant smile on his face”
    * Tub
    * the block speaks - “Earlier, when I said I had a cheesy though…I was going to say that it occurs to me that a man’s house is a lot like one’s soul. You take care of it, and it takes care of you. Heh. Don’t know why I felt so weird to say it”
        * 1. I get it, that’s a weird thing to say to someone you just met.
        * 2. Yeah, you’re right, that’s pretty cheesy.
        * 3. But there’s a bit of truth in it, no?
        * goin’ with 3 for sure. ’tis how I would say it.
    * “… Anyway. So. Housekeeping. Let’s keep doing this”
        * Hmm…Did I say the right thing there? Probably wouldn’t have done all that much if I chose the others. The response could be generalized.
    * Books.
    * Pillows 
        * “Can’t have these folks coming home to a messy couch”
    * “I’m glad he made this. I’m glad he found some peace”
        * “Question: Do you enjoy this?”
        * And it all vanished.
    * “The music stops, the companion is gone, and it’s time to leave. The door at the top of the hill is open as well.”
        * Time to get back to reality
    * “Again, you can’t stay inside the dark space for too long. You just can’t - you have to keep moving it’s how you stay alive”
    * I scan around the house again to see if everything is tidy.
        * Almost - the next thing would’ve been the dishes.
    * and now, curiously, the big windows are missing.
    * It is time to move forward.
    * I look back and see the big hill I climbed upon reaching the door. “I’m king of the world” resonates in my mind.
    * The door, I see, is now gone. It is open - there was no puzzle but cleaning up.
    * I approach the lamppost.
    * “…Which is the point of the puzzle doors right? That sooner or later you have to pick up and move…I really thought that was the point of it.”

* Chapter 11: Lecture (September 2009)
    * “Items you love at members-only prices”
    * “This one gets a bit… goofy”
    * I spawn within a lecture hall - perhaps in college. There is a yellow blockhead with the text “Talk.” I see no other ‘students.’ It talks.
        * “Why did you come here today?”
        * “Was it to improve your life?”
        * “Was it to get a better job?”
        * “Was it to make your relationships more meaningful?”
        * “No.”
        * “You came here to become PERFECT.”
    * I teleport to a different seat
        * “This workshop is going to teach you to be perfect.”
        * “I want you to look at your friend, the people in your life that look at you and think:”
        * ‘wow, this person is a better human being than I am’
        * “Right now, what do you think about the way in your own life?”
        * “Who do you know that is so well a person that it makes you disgusted to be yourself?”
        * “Compared to whom, you feel useless”
        * “Selfish”
        * “Ungrateful”
        * “I intend to make you that person”
    * I jump around again. I still cannot move, but i can still look.
        * “Perfection IS within your grasp”
        * “And the question is not how do we do it, but how do we do it EFFORTLESSLY”
        * “This is easy”
        * “It is so easy”
        * “It is so easy”
        * “Being perfect is effortless”
    * The perspective shifts - I am now the teacher. I have one student, a purple blockhead with “Listen” on it. In front of me I see a black hole that I couldn’t see as the student. Black holes cause so much incredible pressure. I hear screams. I see the chat system - this time a few of the options are greyed out.
        * 1. This is the key: how do I achieve it with no effort.
        * 2. (grey) On the way to work i told an elderly person to start contributing to society.
        * 3. (grey) Kids should not follow their dreams
        * ಠ_ಠ;
    * “About halfway through the game the perspective shifts, and you play as the teacher, And suddenly, you discover that your teacher is just as afraid and as bigoted as you are (you can move around the classroom now)”
        * I see that you cannot go up the steps into the supernova-black hole-thing. None of the doors work. At the top of the steps is the lamppost.
    *  choose option 1
        * 1. Well let me tell you right now: If it isn’t effortless, then it’s not the right answer.
        * 2. (grey) I still love you, it’s just that you make me feel cold on the inside
        * 3. (grey) Being alone must be awful
        * the other options are gone…can I choose the others? Well like…hmm. 
        * I go with 1 again. 
    * What if I go with the others?…
        * 1. (grey) Thank goodness all of you perceive me as being wise and intelligent!
        * 2. (grey) Drinking is not hurting my life.
        * 3. If you are torturing yourself trying to find the right solutions for your life, you’re not doing it right.
        * The grey appear to be inner-monologue. These are…distractions, perhaps.
    * …
        * 1. (grey) Do you understand that you won’t be happy until you love me? This is for you.
        * 2. Seek out only one thing: What is the easiest, simplest path forward.
        * 3. Ew. I’m developing a cyst. Gross.
        * I don’t want to choose any of them. You can’t really love someone anyway until ya love yourself first too. Easiest, simplest path - that can be misleading. Three is just totally irrelevant. Perhaps i’ll come back later and see… if possible. Is that missing the point though? Hmm.
    * …
        * 1. (grey) HAHAHA JSUT KIDDING.
        * 2. (grey) anyone want to do some ecstasy after this?
            * lol
        * 3. There is no truth. There is no path.
            * Oh, I like that one better.
    * hmm
        * 1. (grey) What if i’m not a good teacher…
            * more inner-monologue. Like the idle thoughts.
        * 2. Do what is easiest. Do what is simplest. Feel what is true.
            * Feel what is true is true. The other two … i’m a bit doubtful.
        * 3. (grey) HOLY SHIT you guys something is coming out of the back of the room! LOOK OUT!!
            * at which point the people would go and send professor here to a mental facility ಠ_ಠ
    * interesting…
        * 1. Nothing. No one.
        * 2. (grey) it’s coming for you! It’s going to destroy you!
        * 3. (grey) Everyone run! RUN!!!
        * the latter two express extreme fear. Would incite it too. Let’s see what the golden one leads too. perhaps “…can get in your way” or something.
    * hm
        * 1. Perfection
        * 2. Perfection
        * 3. Perfection
    * “I felt pretty hard for this one. I feel like it’s one of the most relatable experiences you can have…to assume that some other person is perfect…and totally fulfilled in every way, and completely miss all of the little flaws that make them painfully arrogant(?). I think about this game a lot these days…”

* Chapter 12: Theater (January 2010)
    * “This one took a lot longer for Coda to make. It was 4 months between this and the last one. Twice as long as it took him to make any other game before this. And it’s not like it’s particularly complex so I found that a little…strange at the time”
    * I am standing in a room - the couches are the same as the one from the prison level. There are the shelves there too. There are the buildings. in front of me is an entrance to a corridor with a yellow “STAGE” sign pointing to the right. There appears to be nothing in the room, so I proceed.
    * I am behind the stage. There are black closet box things everywhere. There are many stage lever mechanisms around. I cannot interact with them.
    * I discover that strangely, a lot of the boxes behind the stage have no collision.
    * There is a ladder leading to the catwalk that I cannot climb. Possibly later. One of the boxes has really high collision detection. I can actually climb onto of it. At first i thought I was floating. Probably a bug.
    * I proceed onto the stage
    * SUDDENLY I GET SCARED AS THE LIGHTS TURN ON OUT OF NOWHERE WITH A LOUD SOUND LIKE @#$% MAN DAS SCARY. @—@
    * I am a performer. “Here you will be playing as me. We are at a gathering of professionals. First you’ll start out by leaning against this wall.”
        * a wall emerges from the ground
        * A woman emerges too. “She’s a professional photographer of animals. It’s your dream to be able to photograph animals professionally.”
        * “This is your one chance to learn something from her, to gain something, to succeed”
        * “Go on, say something.”
            * 1. Hello
            * 2. Sorry, I have to leave
            * 3. Where is the bathroom?
            * Going with 1. 
        * “That’s it?! You need to actually converse with her. Be a human being.”
            * 1. I’m super scared right now
            * 2. I like you
            * 3. Here are all my hopes and dreams:
            * mmm…3. 3 would start something.
        * “No no, you’re completely missing the tone of the conversation! I was reserved but I knew what I wanted, I was confident. For some reason it was just that one moment, but I was confident.”
        * “Maybe you need a better feel of the setting. There were people all around us”
            * bumper-like things emerge. They’re cylindrically conical, and they have a blue ring around the near-bottom.
        * “These cones that bounce when you touch them will represent the people nearby. Now try again.”
            * 1. You must have worked really hard to get where you are
            * 2. I’ll bet you have learned to lean into the pain
            * 3. What are some sacrifices you’ve needed to make?
            * incomplete. Without interest these will not spark something. Hmm… I know this feel. I choose 1.
        * “You’re messing it all up again! You’ll freak her out if the conversation gets that personal that quickly! Do you not realize how important this was to me? I’ll never get another opportunity like this again! Everything was riding on this!”
        * “Hmm I want to try something… Try stepping back from the stage.
    * There is a lamppost. The stage is clear and infinite besides that.
    * A big cage FALLS. Slams shut. There is no second chance. It is cold. It is a cage.
    * It seems that the only way to go is back.
        * “Oh yes, now this is working! This is what I like!”
    * “The game ends with this…eery premonition of what’s going to happen next in Coda’s life”
    * there is no way to access the lamppost, though it’s visible.
    * “The solution to social anxiety - to fears of having to perform and chase success… The answer for Coda is to withdraw. To…hide himself away. Which is what leads to scenarios like the stairs that slowed you down several games ago…where it becomes harder and harder to reach Coda’s inner-landscape because he keeps retreating. He just keeps backing away from possible connections to anyone but himself”
        * Holy shit.
￼
    * (above: an image of a gift I got for a friend that who reminded me of this)
    * “And to be honest, I didn’t consider it very healthy, when I first played this game…”
        * wait, what? … 
    * “I-i-it looks to me like he was trying to justify the idea of just…disconnecting yourself from the world. And that wasn’t what I wanted for him or his games. ‘Cause I thought and feel like a lot of his games are inviting me to connect. To connect with this person. To bring them closer.”
    * “…But what can ya do. After this, Coda went off and took another five months to make a new game”

…

* Chapter 13: Mobius (June 2010)
    * Something about a mobius strip - if flashed briefly so I couldn’t see the whole of it.
    * There are people panicking. Their heads are red. Their titles…blind
        * “What’s going on”
        * “Something enormous just appeared on the radar.”
        * “I can’t die like this. I can’t die like this”
    * I am aboard the SS.Whisper. 
    * There is another in the back
        * “Someone get help!”
        * “There was a giant door and then my vision went black”
        * “I don’t know why, it happened to me too!”
        * “You can’t see anything either”
    * I see this giant door hurtling towards the ship.
        * Lots of dialogue about not wanting to be killed by this giant door. They are all deathly afraid. You as the player remain up on top deck with open-eyes. There is no blindness.
    * Suddenly the game cuts to black as the ship crashes. It seems to have restarted- but this time you have dialogue. I must act fast, i cannot analyze things here - that’s not how it was meant to be played. 
    * “You should probably open your eyes if you haven’t already. And there is a solution by the way”
    * I see an open path that I swear wasn’t there. There is a ramp heading down to the lower level. there is also an elevator. I think…I think I need to find a switch. I go up to the elevator and see someone. He is different. He is not saying anything until approached. His head is pink. His title: Truth
        * “The only way to stop it is to speak. Say something that is honest!”
        * …deep. And true too. 
    * i chose “I am bursting with creative energy” - as … suspected, it wasn’t right. it wasn’t truthful, and the fate is sealed. Time loops again.
    * Of course… the truth is the 2nd option: “I can’t keep making these”
        * “Yes, that’s it, that’s the truth!”
        * The door pauses and the dramatic music stops.
    * More choices:
        * 1. It’s not fun anymore
        * 2. I’m out of ideas
        * 3. It’s draining me
    * “Like I said, I was getting concerned. First off (tone rises), he’s never been this explicit in his work about exactly what he’s thinking. So, where is that coming from? … But then… even weirder, his work has potentially stopped being an outlet for him.”
        * v . v
    * “Not that he’s having trouble iterating on ideas, but he literally just can’t think of ideas anymore.”
        * I get this feeling sometimes when certain events occur or certain chains of thought take place.
        * 2. I’m all out of ideas
        * “Yes that’s it, keep going!”
    * “And in person he was being a lot more distant than usual, like…y’know how sometimes a person will just…deflect anything you say to keep themselves disconnected all the time- it was that kind of thing…”
    * “Here was the point in my relationship with Coda that I started to wonder if he needed my help in some way”
        * 2. “I can’t figure out how to say the thing…”
        * “You’re doing it! It’s working”
        * 1. I’m alone.
        * “We’re going to be okay.”
    * “His games are going to get more desperate from here-on-out”
    * “After this game it’s almost six months before he finishes something new.”

* Chapter 14: Island (December 2014)
    * I start in a room of all white. I am given one of 3 options
        * 1. Hello?
        * 2. Where am I?
        * 3. What is this?
        * Going with 2…Where am I. 
    * A cliffside emerges. The fog lifts slightly. I am on a floating island. In the center is a single tree.
        * 1. Where did this island come from
        * 2. How do I get out of here?
        * 3. Hello, is anyone there?
        * well.. there is clearly something there that’s listening. 3 seems redundant now. I’m not incredibly desperate to get off just yet. Where did It come from.
    * Another island appears, similar to this one it has a tree on it. It is connected to this one through rocks.
    * As I move to the next the island I had disappears and a new voice emerges
        * “Is that a person? How lovely!”
        * “It’s been a long time since i’ve talked with anyone”
        * “…”
        * “What’s wrong? You look lost.”
    * I cannot see this person. I am presented with more questions:
        * 1. I’m completely out of ideas
        * 2. When I try to create I feel empty
        * 3. I have nothing left to give my work
        * … Coda feels all of these. At the root of it, I see number 2. Ideas are one thing, but enjoyment of those ideas is what can bring forth more naturally.
    * More islands. The tree on this island is bent in a somewhat strange way. there’s another floating island too: it’s smaller and inaccessible, but it is there.
        * “Oh no!”
        * “What happened? Did something change?”
    * More choices:
        * 1. There was a machine that kept me going, and it stopped.
        * 2. I’m trying to find this engine that used to protect me - to start it again.
        * … whisper machine perhaps. Whispers of ideas. It felt unreal - like there was actually something there whispering everything right that someone could do.
        * I choose… number 2. It’s slightly more ambiguous. It leaves room for more thought and explanation.
    * New islands emerge - this one has multiple trees and a hole in the middle of it.
        * “Wait, you’re looking for a machine?”
        * “I think I know where it is!”
        * “It isn’t far”
    * options:
        * 1. What??
        * 2. You have to take me to it.
        * 3. I need to see it, to know why it stopped.
        * …three.
    * There is also a boulder just past the gap on this island. On this island the sounds of the ocean are starting to emerge from the background
    * Another island - this time double-layered. 
        * Perhaps I do know why it stopped, come to think of it. Because he chose? Maybe? Not chose in the concrete way of course…
    * This island shows upon the upper level, the progress of a tree as it grows. Its growth over time. 
        * “I can take you to it but there’s a problem”
        * “It’s guarded by a difficult puzzle”
        * “If you can help me solve the puzzle, i’ll take you to the machine.”
        * “Deal?”
    * “If the last game featured Coda talking explicitly about his creative frustrations, this one turns it up to 100…”
    * “Now, put yourself in my shoes playing this: Here’s a friend, whose work is exhibiting signs of struggle, frustration, anxiety, depression, even? And yet - Still - he keeps making games. He keeps, throwing himself into the grinder, even when he clearly doesn’t have the energy for it anymore. Why? What is it for?”
    * options:
        * 1. Deal.
        * 2. Deal.
        * 3. It doesn’t matter what I say does it? We’re going to end up there on way or another, right?
    * This upper level is accessible by a hill that was at first hidden. It looks nice.
        * I am slightly skeptical of my choices. I choose the 2nd “Deal.”
    * Another island emerges. There are two thick trees on the sides. In the center between them is one of those Japanese arch things.
        * “Perfect.”
        * “Come along, I’ll show you”
    * The bridge fogs up and i can barely see around. It’s clear that the island has vanished.
    * “At the time I thought this was all because of how Isolated he was. He was in his own little bubble, just sitting at his computer all-day, not showing these games to anyone… not releasing them onto the internet. And so… He didn’t have anyone outside of himself to connect with.”
    * “He had no outlet to ground himself on”
    * I follow the bridge until I reach a door with a lever. This is the same asset as the one prison level. It was there, albeit briefly, but this definitely looks to be almost the same.
        * “This is the puzzle”
        * “What do you think”
    * Options:
        * 1. Hey, I recognize this!
        * 2. I’ve solved this before!
        * 3. This is easy!
        * number 1 or 2. How about…2.
    * response:
        * “Oh wonderful!”
        * “Can you tell me how its solved?”
    * I move and notice that the same crawling thing is happening like at the prison.
    * I’ll do that and see if something happens given the options.
    * The fog inside the door is white and very bright, unlike before where it was black.
    * “You can’t…talk yourself…out of loneliness. It doesn’t work that way. You can’t be the one writing both the questions and the answers. Then there’s no movement. then there’s no circulation. If all of your anxieties are being channeled into your work then if the work ever fails you have no backup and you’re just going to crash!”
        * true :/
        * “Ha, that was so simple!”
        * “I can’t believe i’ve never solved it before this”
    * On the other side is more bridge, more light - it continues for a bit.
    * I have come to the bridge’s peak. It played a small sound when i arrived and i swear the fog lifted just a bit.
    * Just over the peak is the arch once again. And a rectangular doorway waiting.
    * The background sounds change to ones with shake breathing. As if they’re going to cry soon.
    * This engine…I am taken to a room with words on walls. it isn’t in the traditional sense, is it.
    * Options:
        * 1. What are you talking about
        * 2. There’s no machine here
        * 3. There are just some words on walls
        * I choose 1
    * Response:
        * “Trust me, you’ll see”
        * “You need to say that your work is fun and easy”
        * “You need to say that game development is simple and joyous and that you love it 100% of the time”
    * Options:
        * 1. Okay…making games is simple
        * 2. Sure…making games is easy
        * 3. Alright…making games is effortless
    * The walls begin to break. The cage has been damaged - but in a positive way
    * Response:
        * “Ahh, that feels wonderful”
    * Options:
        * 1. …but it wasn’t true
        * 2. Why did the walls just crumble
        * 3. Why did I feel so awful when I said that.
        * picked 3
    * Response:
        * “Don’t worry about it just keep talking”
        * “Keep saying that creation is easy”
    * Options:
        * 1. When I make games I feel completely energized
        * 2. I am constantly excited and enthusiastic in my work
        * 3. It is easy. It never stops being easy.
        * …It is easy, to create. Itself, is simple. It’s just the bits in between. Number 3.
    * Response:
        * “Yes that’s wonderful”
        * “Keep going”
    * “Seeing this game at the time that he made it seems really unhealthy to me. I was watching him do this to himself, and I hated it. I hated seeing him so trapped. it’s like- … Video games - are not - worth. this amount of suffering.
    * Options:
        * 1. Every time I make something i feel better about myself
        * 2. Just never stop creating and you’ll never feel bad.
        * 3. It’s such a simple solution.
        * I pick…3. It can’t really…be put into words unless you believe it’s simple enough to. It is three.
    * Response:
        * “Perfect.”
    * “This is someone I really cared about, and I used to get so much joy out of seeing him create.”
    * I notice that with every word the text of the unknown voice gets a deeper and darker red. I wonder… probably just optical illusion
    * “Seeing him like this was the worst thing…for me”
    * Options:
        * 1. None of this is helping
        * 2. I’m going to vomit
        * 3. Please! Where is the machine!
    * Response:
        * Patience. You have to trust me
        * I promise this will work. 
        * Please, continue
    * Options
        * 1. Pain breezes effortlessly off me
        * 2. any sacrifices i make for my work are worth it 100% of the time
        * 3. 
        * ……. This is dangerous. 
    * Response:
        * Yes
        * More
        * Keep going
    * Options:
            * … hmm
        * 1. There is no shame, no fear, no guilt
        * 2. I will be saved by my work
        * 3. I believe this, unquestioningly. I am a vessel for certainty.
            * All of these don’t feel…quite right. There must be something …
            * I choose number 1. It feels the most right out of them all.
    * “I dunno…this is what I felt at the time. It’s hard to explain it. I wanted to stop more than anything. I had never felt so rotten. I just…I needed more than I had ever needed anything…for this…to stop.”
    * The walls go down at last.
    * Response: 
        * “Incredible”
        * “That’s it”
        * “I’m free”
        * “I’m free”
            * CALLED IT… ;–;
    * Ahead of me is the prison only this time…i’m on the outside. There is also the lamppost at last.
    * The crying gets very loud.
    * Within this prison is a girl. Crying. On the couch. Same assets as before. 
    * All this crying is distorted. Eery.
    * I touch the bars and am transferred to the next realm.
    * “…But it didn’t stop. After finishing this one, Coda takes another seven months and then comes up with a new game.”

* Chapter 15: The Machine (May 2011)
    * I stand outside of an actual looking prison. Around me is black everywhere. In front of the door to the prison, there is a guard. You can tell from his uniform, the grayness, and the fact that his block-head says “Guard” on it.
    * I approach.
    * Guard:
        * “Ma’am, we’re glad to see you’ve arrived safely”
        * “We’ve captured the Machine. It’s waiting for you now”
        * “You can begin the interrogation whenever you’d like”
    * Options:
        * I intend to be…
        * 1. Quick
        * 2. Quiet
        * 3. Brutal
        * Option number 2 is the safest here. By far. It’s the best choice in my opinion.
    * Response: 
        * “Very Good”
        * Just be warned that someone called the press, so we may have a bit of attention on our hands
        * Also, one more thing you should know about the machine:
        * It calls itself Coda
            * ; ~ ;
    * Press is literally everywhere inside the room. All of them have yellow box heads with the word “Press” on them. A bit of attention is an understatement. In front of me is a wide corridor - or what would be wide if not for the press - that’s dark and linear. You can see all the rust/grime on the bars holding this prison up.
    * Everyone asking for answers, interviews, if it’ll be punished, what’ll happen, how it was captured, where it is now. 
    * The room opens and I am greeted by a literal machine. It is a big engine block. the room is octagonal.
    * Options:
        * 1. you stopped
    * “And of course, it’s the machine.”
    * The machine is currently doing nothing.
    * Options:
        * 1. You stopped feeding us
        * 2. Your work was keeping us alive
        * 3. Your work was keeping us healthy
    * Options:
        * 1. These people out there…can you imagine the pain you’ve put them through?
        * 2. It was because of your creations that any of us could make it through, any day
        * 3. How could we possibly go back to trusting you to do this job? 
            * I don’t like this :/
    * Options: 
        * 1. How about this for a start: You need to go out there and apologize to the people
        * 2. You need to admit that you’ve let the people out there suffer
        * 3. I’ve been so along
            * …3
    * Options:
        * 1. Apologize for leaving me
    * Options:
        * 1. No, nothing?
        * 2. Think carefully, I know how to hurt you.
        * 3. I have seen the thing you fear
            * 3 perhaps? sure.
    * Options:
        * 1. Alright then. I will apologize to the people on your behalf.
    * The doors behind me are thrown open. There is a spotlight. The press has moved. I am outside now. The buildings all around are the same color, same general texture - they are rusting away. I feel like Coda designed it after the stock picture of the city - only this is a twisted/apocalyptic version
    * Optons:
        * 1. MY FOLLOWERS
        * 2. MY FRIENDS
            * going with 2
    * Options:
        * 1. It falls on me to deliver bad news.
        * 2. I have a troubling revelation
            * … 2 again
    * Options
        * 1. The machine refuses to apologize to us
        * 2. The machine refuses to admit that it deliberately hurt us
            * umm…hmm…tough one. Two again.
    * Options:
        * 1. But this is not important! We are stronger than it thinks we are!
        * 2. We will find a way to live without it! We do not need games!
            * Yeah, 2 again. I like the 2 route this time.
    * Options:
        * 1. Let us pay it retribution!
        * 2. Let us show it that we are not failures!
    * Options: 
        * 1. Follow me! We will destroy the machine!
        * 2.Follow me! We will destroy everything the machine has created!
            * 2.
    * The door opens behind me. I see a giant coliseum. Looks like a big stadium of some sort. Reminds me of those circular play things i heard about in shakespearian times.
    * No…it is instead a stage.
    * Here we go…
    * I am equipped with a gun. I am reminded that I can fire it by clicking.
    * After studying the area around briefly - this is that place. only not fully. There is nothing i can do to interact with it however, besides firing. Welp, here goes.
    * I am firing it - shattering space and time. Letting the light in at last. Destroying the true prison. .. right?
    * Options:
        * 1. Coda, I’ll make sure your work dies here! 
        * 2. Coda, I’ll make sure you are known forever.
            * … well this is a tough decision. I think number 2 is still best though.
    * Options: 
        * 1. Isn’t that what you’re scared of? Being exposed to the views of others, every day, forever? Seen in naked Clarity?
    * “So now the work is becoming self-destructive. And i’ll tell you. At the time I first played this game, a short time after he made it, here’s what I’m thinking to myself:”
    * “I’m thinking that…Coda is stuck in his own head, and that it’s having a very negative effect on him, and that all he needs to do is just start showing his work to people…to get some actual feedback on his games. It might get him out of isolation. And it occurred to me that I could be the one to initiate it. Because it never would be Coda that starts soliciting feedback. So, what if I did it for him?”
    * “To see the difference it would make - to start having actual conversations with other human beings, would that bring him out of his mental spiral? Would it give him confidence in himself? Would it bring meaning back into his work? 
    * I am falling through the ideas room
    * “So I started showing Coda’s work to people. I took this one, and the islands you just played. The theater, the notes, the housecleaning game, and some of the prison escape games. I brought them to people that I knew, and trusted. I asked their opinions…and the great part, is that they really love the games!”
    * I am falling towards the door. a silhouette. 
    * “Huh. The point of it all is just to give him some sort of external reference point, but…but they genuinely loved his work! There was nothing for him to be afraid of!”
    * I fall through the door, into the darkness.
    * I see the machine, right by the lamppost.
        * “Put down your weapon”
    * I instead am forcibly armed with it. I cannot turn or move. Only hope that something will happen that won’t force me. But, i’ll wait for a bit. or perhaps it does need to be done? 
    * Hmm…the image of the machine must be stowed away, introduced to light. It must be cleansed.
    * “Can you see why this was what I felt was the right thing to do? Because it’s the thing that I always feel like I need. To be told that my work is good! That I am good. whe-when someone really connects with a thing that i’ve made- when they see themselves purely in my work… there’s nothing that feels better. And then I got to give that very same feeling to my friend!”
    * “I had done something… I had really felt like I had done something good- like, like I was a good person who felt like there was a friend who was in trouble and was unhappy and maybe didn’t like themselves - and I could fix it! If I could give him this gift, maybe I could fix the problem!” 
    * I shot the thing once to trigger the dialogue - the gun is wobbling as if stability is ending.
    * “When they told me how much they enjoyed his games it was the best feeling. It was the absolute best feeling. It made me feel so happy! So beautifully, beautifully happy.”
    * “Well… So anyway. Coda just finishes this game and, really he just kind of, takes off for awhile. This is June of 2011 and I didn’t hear anything from him for several weeks, I  guess? Umm…and so out of nowhere one day I get an e-mail. And it’s got a private link to a new game of Coda’s”
    * “This one is called the tower…and to my knowledge it’s the last game that Coda ever made…so, let’s take a look.”
    * …

* Chapter 16: Tower (June 2011)
    * Immediately this eerie-isa music starts to play in the background. I get a certain sense of unease. The room is tall and cubical. There is white walls with tall, beige-brown and orange slabs 
    * In the next room is darkness - there is a fork. Looks almost like a labyrinth. I’ll go…the right path. But it’s a loop.
    * “And this is where I have trouble saying anything meaningful about Coda’s work…because more than anything else, the tower just feels distant.”
    * In the room there is a large tower. It is red. The ceilings curve upwards to its top.
    * “It feels like it’s trying to distance itself from everything else. It’s a very cold game…”
    * I walk into the first spotlight and turn around. I cannot see into the corridor.
    * Second spotlight - same. The tower…i’m not sure what quite about it it is…It. It does seem like it’s getting farther away with how the perspective does something.
    * I hear a “nuclear” alarm going off every now and then. 
    * I see that the ceiling is uneven - just shifting just a tiny bit as it goes to the top and fades out of sight.
    * I am at the foot of the tower. It is gigantic. it seemed a lot smaller from far away. There are two very impressive pillars on the side.
    * Above the entrance to another corridor is a large, red, slightly-rusted…gate (I assume) it may close on me when i go through. At least - I think it’s a gate.
    * It has not closed as I step into the first spotlight behind it.
    * The next room… 
    * “This room, actually, has a maze in it.”
    * I feel like I am in the center of judgement - like some sort of big, giant council is watching me. A tower… can mean many things. 
    * “…except that … all the walls of the maze are invisible.”
    * I touch a wall and get sent back to the start as my screen flashes red and a demonic hiss-gasp thing plays for a second. Almost like choking. I wonder.
    * “It goes beyond ‘not being meant to be played’ it actually seems to despise the player for trying to play it at all”
    * Metaphor for life perhaps. I could see it. Invisible walls that will just weird-you out, perhaps scare you, to turn-you off to moving forward. I’ll need to think a lot to get past this invisible maze. I intend to complete it the right way. Perhaps a truly dedicated player will cause this tower to open up to at least the one. 
    * “But, I do want to show you the rest of the level, so, when you’re ready, press Enter and i’ll put a bridge over the maze” 
    * lol nop. We gon’ do this legit. Let’s see…what should my unit of measurement be.
    * He puts the bridge up automatically after awhile
    * “And to be fair, this is’t the first game that’s needed some modification to be playable…like the house cleaning game! Y’know, that one used to actually loop the cleaning chores and you’d just clean the house forever.”
        * …I still don’t like it though :c
    * “I had to cut it off so you could exit the house and the game would end. But…that game had an idea that it was actually trying to communicate. What’s the deeper idea behind the invisible maze?”
        * I believe it’s meant to be a struggle. It’s supposed to show what it’s like to go up against one of his ideas that throw him in a loop for ages. It’d take a normal human being so long of constant trial and error if they would complete it legitimately, that it would sort of line up with Coda’s thoughts. I feel like it’s saying “you should not proceed until you have suffered as I have, and then you may understand.” …or something of the sort.
        * a person would need to constantly be thinking about how it’s completed, where to turn, where to stop, which paths are safe, and which will ultimately lead him nowhere, even when it’s been fully explored for hours on end. That is what it feels like to be spiraling. That is what it feels like when your mind is an engine that will not stop but needs an oil change - or something to keep it going. It gets burnt out,  impatient at the player and the world around it, fast.
        * At every wall you get sent back to the beginning of your thoughts and feel the need to complete it again and again to get back (if that’s how the mind works) until it’s completed. There is infinite determination in this individual, but finite patience, and that’s what drives them insane. 
        * I shall proceed. 
    * I come to a twisting stairway within this tower. I cannot fall off. I proceed upwards.
    * In the distance i see many more stairs. It reminds me of a hotel.
    * They take me through a corridor, and here there is a new type of puzzle. Wow.
    * “The only way past this challenge is to randomly guess the six-digit code. It’s frustrating to me, ‘cause it’s the opposite of everything else Coda has made.”
        * I’d assume it’s frustrating to him too. Hmm. 
    * “It doesn’t encourage thought or engagement — it doesn’t ask anything of me except a lot of my time”
        * like the stray thoughts that they chase and try to figure out. 
    * “If I could have reached him during this time, then maybe i could’ve asked him…but I couldn’t. I still don’t really understand why this is here.”
    * “I’ll put the code on the ground here though so that you can move on”
        * aww. 
        * code is 151617. 
        * Interesting… 
        * So wait…I wrote 151618. I do believe… that something doesn’t seem right. Could it be if it passes over it once? I wonder.
    * The stairway unfolds. It connects. I feel bad though.
        * Definitely coming back to this level later and experimenting a bit with those numbers. Perhaps…all is not quite as it seems.
    * I cannot fall from this stairway. The view from up here is incredible in a unique sort of way. 
        * I think back now to the other notes I never got to see… I wonder what they said.
    * there is a hole here. There is no going back once I go down. The other ledge i can get to hides nothing. 
    * “The switch to open this door is actually on the other side of the door - meaning that it’s literally impossible to solve from this side. So…even if you brute-forced your way through the first two challenges and got to this point - there’s actually no way to progress.”
        * Note 40: NNEED OTHER SIDE! DOOR Y U SO
        * Note 41: Makes a game. Includes door. Cannot open. Thanks
        * Note 42: OPEN SESAME
        * Note 43: door how open
    * “And it’s scary for me - the idea of Coda cutting himself entirely. Saying… ‘Well that’s it, that’s the end of the conversation.’ not giving me any way to fix the problem. I feel like a failure I guess…when I feel like I can’t…fix the problem.“
        * Perhaps that’s it too. Is there a timer on the mechanism?
    * “But I can open this door for you so…let me do that”
        * if the switch is on the other side i’m going right back and shutting it on me. Hmm.
    * “Was I a failure? For not understanding this game?”
        * Hmm. Most can’t. I can’t fully. I can interpret, not understand fully and completely.
    * “I-I don’t know why I would be it’s not like…everything needs to have a solution. But I feel it somehow. I feel like I failed. And I don’t understand why”
        * Perhaps that’s it too.
        * Yeah…It’s not possible to get back through that. …alright, I proceed…
        * Seems to me like he’s saying “i’ll come out when I feel like it. Until then, leave me in my shell” or something. Maybe… Though I don’t think that’s entirely true either.
    * Still as eerily beautiful as ever. I think I just heard a train as i traverse up this next flight of steps. Then I go down slightly and see the orange path once again, reminding me of my … inability to complete the puzzle - to suffer for quite as long as Coda has.
    * “I remember it was June of 2011. I’m playing this for the very first time. And as i’m playing, I’m thinking to myself… ‘I don’t know this person.’”
        * Correct. No one does. One does not simply know someone entirely.
    * “I have no idea who this person is…”
        * You do not, for better or worse, know what is going on in their life altogether - their past, present, or future really - you could possibly be trying to solve a problem that isn’t there, or you could be doing the man a favor. It is impossible to tell without facts.
    * “It wasn’t the guy I knew it wasn’t my friend. I had come to so many conclusions from looking at all of his work up to this point, and then suddenly none of them…“
    * I ascend more steps. The steps ascend into the shadows. I go with it.
    * At each pause, there is a moment to reflect. You overcame that…or did you?
    * The steps look amazing. They are stairs form a dream. I cannot see or explain, but I can feel barely something, can I? …I could be wrong.
    * Interesting. There is a fork again - stairs but they seem to be connecting the same room 
    * “I had been trying to though. That was the thing. For years I was trying to get to know him. To understand who he actually was and what he stood for”
        * Perhaps this is a way of saying, “I don’t know” either.
    * “I asked him - so many times - to just tell me please what his games mean to him. I asked him please to tell me what the 3 dots mean…and he wouldn’t” 
        * I have noticed those. That small pattern.
        * This game is literally poetry. He’s not a writer - he’s a poet.
            * Note 51: A game where you leave notes and suddenly everyone’s a poet
    * This room is around a giant cliff. The center contains a hole into the abyss that i cannot jump into. It seems pointless - but is it?
    * I emerge from the room and get a slightly closer look at all the other stairs. Fascinating bunch aren’t they. oh well, not on this path at the moment. I look up and see that the building has slanted upwards a little. 
    * I look down and see stairways that I don’t recall taking. Was I on those?
    * I’ve come high up but there is still yet more. could those all be others’ towers?
    * There is a small slab sticking out up another flight of stairs. Could it have a meaning? any particular reason for being there?
    * i go back and look around. i can see lights of red. This is the only red color lighting i’ve seen in this whole area.
    * Another corner and another flight of stairs. Hmm…
    * “I just felt so strongly that if I could’ve connected with him… That if I could somehow make his work my own that I could somehow be happy. I needed to see myself in someone else.”
        * I look up and to the right. there are three of these red light emitters.
    * “…I needed…to be someone other than me. But he stopped. And Left. It felt somehow like I had failed.” 
        * He trusted you with his personal mind. You shared it. Opened it up. 
        * This is his world. He invited you. 
        * But he didn’t offer everything. A candy bowl. Take one. This is yours.
    * I hear the breathing become slightly more intense. i hear the alarm sound once more.
    * There is another red light above a narrow section. Few would notice it or pay them mind. I almost feel watched.
    * Here I arrive at what I think is a true fork. Left or right. I choose once more. Right. Maybe left another time. 
    * Separating the two is an orange wall. There is symmetry to these paths.
        * This orange wall is…actually one of the gates. The giant, massive ones.
    * I look down and cannot see below. I hear a new for of like…crowing sound play now. 
    * Oh ok then the paths rejoin once more, quickly - just to get around the orange thing
    * I’ve reached what appear to be the final steps to the very top.
    * “Where did I screw up”
        * I approach the first plateau
    * There are two large rectangular pillars. the tops of them, anyhow, on the left and right side. I look back and peer into it - nothing.
    * I reach the top and look back again. hmm.
    * Yet another fork. Left this time.
    * They once again rejoin quickly.
        * Before me I see out of the corner of my screen a orange room. The floor is reflective.
        * I see actual light. That appears to be…obstructed - finally. It looks like branches or better yet - the like…steel leg things that the Empire State Building stands on. That kind of style.
        * I can make out in this room, some text.
        * The floor is wooden.
    * …It is time to proceed.
    * It is a note…
        * Dear Davey, 
        * Thank you for your interest in my games. I need to ask you not to speak with me anymore.
    * Rough…
    * “I…am the reason that you stopped making games, aren’t I…”
    * “…”
        * You can feel it
    * “It’s because of what I did. Poisoned it for you. ”
    * You can see the projector. The light source. It is the thing projecting this message. It looks like the room is…cozy but not at once. It all looks nice…like a structured museum. 
        * Upon one window is clean above. The second however looks filthy, a bit slightly broken, or battered. Tattered. Tarnished a bit. The Right one.
        * I quickly connect a few dots and google the hemispheres of the brain
        * … The right hemisphere of the brain…performs tasks that have to do with creativity and the arts. ‘Art awareness, Creativity, Imagination, Intuition, Insight, Holistic Thought, Music Awareness, 3-D forms, Left hand control’
        * .. these windows. The tower. This statement that isn’t ever meant to be seen. This is him. This is how he sees himself. He sees himself as this tower and within his mind is this sentence. How does he tell you, but other then letting you see inside him himself? To access this tower you need to traverse invisible mazes that can set you back at any time. Guess wildly at this number, which is actually a pattern all along, ascend this giant climb that takes patience to get through, and of course, be let-in by him himself. Trying to break in will result in that. You see it. 
        * This thought lingers on his mind. He doesn’t know how to say it. He can’t think of it anymore - his creativity is tattered a bit. He is unsure of how to handle it.
        * It is impossible to truly put a person or purpose into words fully and completely. A purpose is a collection of feelings, memories, motives, etc - perhaps in trying to explain it all, the creative side got overshadowed by this logic. This will to attempt to explain. Maybe.
        * This light source is coming from the left-back part.
        * …perhaps i’m overthinking again.
    * I see a doorway that opens to grey. I wonder where this takes me. I take one last look at it, noticing how it reminds me of a gym in a way, and proceed. 
    * “I don’t think I ever told you this: … but when I took your work and i was…showing it to people. It actually felt… [laughs] … it felt as though I were responsible for something important- and valuable.”
    * Another room with another message. This has a similar layout. I look above and see no windows this time, but the light is coming from the right this time. 
        * “I wonder at times whether you think I am making these games for you”
    * The bricks on the ceiling are slightly tarnished. There is an exit to my right. I proceed.
    * Within it is a spiral staircase, traveling up-right.
    * Another note:
        * “You’ve infected my personal space that it’s possible that I did begin to plant ‘solutions’ somewhere, hidden between games.”
        * hmm… I do wonder how to see the rest of those notes. They’re intriguing. 
        * He feels for the first time really, judged. He is a poet. There is not quite supposed to be a single right solution, even though there may have been one at the time of creating one, it could have changed as time went on. Here however, it seems to be linear.
    * “And…the people who played them…treated me like I was important. They really listened and cared about what I had to say… Even though I was showing your work it was… I felt good about myself. Finally - for a moment, while I had that, I liked myself…”
    * Light in room emanating from upper-left
    * There are more windows.
        * “If there was an answer, a meaning, would it make you any happier?”
        * “Would you stop taking games and showing them to people against my wishes?”
        * “Giving them something that is not yours to give? Violating the one boundary that keeps me safe?”
        * …
        * “Would you stop changing my games? Stop adding lampposts to them?”
            * holy shit.
    * Marble floors - upper-left. Slanted upwards. It is like a museum
    * “Would you let them simply be what they are?”
        * …I swear…for a moment the reflection…was saying something different.
    * “And suddenly they stopped. And I didn’t have anything left to show people. I just had to be with myself. And as soon as that happened…”
        * “…there was, no feeling at all…nothing…less than nothing”
        * I feel it once in awhile.
    * “What does that mean? …”
    * Another room.
        * “When I am around you I feel physically ill…”
        * “You desperately need something and I cannot give it to you. I literally do not have it.”
    * The walls which the text is on disappears.
        * “Struggling to come up with ideas is not making me depressed. Coming up with new ideas is just part of the process.”
        * “The fact that you think I am frustrated or broken says more about you than about me.”
        * … … …
    * I turn another corner and the atmosphere shifts again. The text is now on brick walls which make up the corridor.
        * “I realize this doesn’t make sense to you just yet”
        * “Which is fine, you’re not my problem to solve”
        * …
        * “But one day I hope it clicks and that you will make peace with this thing you are wrestling” 
    * The floor starts to come apart and the pieces float. There is still collision.
    * “I’m afraid that I did something really stupid because I don’t like myself…”
        * … 
        * “And when you finally see what I am talking about:”
    * …
    * There is a door
        * “Don’t say anything”
    * It is this puzzle. But this time it is not for Coda, I think. Instead… 
￼
    * …I open the door.
    * I encounter the foggy dark room with clouds. On the other side there is the door again. I look back a final time:
￼
    * I close the door.
    * And there is no lever.
    * “That’s…why…I’m releasing this collection of your work…is because..I haven’t been able to find any other way to reach you. I’ve tried everything. And…so a part of me has hope that… if I put this compilation out into the world. And if I put my name on it…then maybe enough people will play on it so that it will find its way to you…so that I can tell you that…”
    * “I’m sorry.”
    * “I know I screwed up. If I apologize to you, truly and deeply…will you start making games again? Please! - I need to feel okay with myself again. And I always felt okay as long as I had your work to see myself in.”
    * “I [stuttering] …i-is something wrong with me?”
    * I notice the door seems to be getting bigger - ever so slightly, growing.
    * “…’cause I know I did an awful thing…and I’m doing it again right now and…I’m showing people your work but I can’t…stop…myself from doing it. That’s how badly I need to feel something in me again- like I’m an addict!!”
    * “There has to be something wrong with me— Can I apologize? Will that work?-Will that fix it?-i-I don’t know I don’t think it will but there’s nothing else I can do just Tell me what you WANT. I’m…I’m sorry. I’m sorry! PLEASE start making games again.”
    * The walls are collapsing in. They will sandwich. In this puzzle there may not be a solution
    * “Please help me - Please GIVE me some of whatever it is that-that makes you complete I want- wwhatever that home is that you just summoned out of nothing that you just put into your work. You were complete in some ways that I never was - and I want to know how…”
    * the doors are growing indeed.
    * “to doub- I wanna know how to be a good person I wanna know how not to hate myself…please? …I’m fading. All I want is to know that i’m going to be okay.”

* Chapter 17: Epilogue
    * There is no date. After the screen cut to black it just loaded this. I am looking up. I see like…a chapel thing. A dome. I see a clock with lamps, Surrounding me is marble place. There are chairs along the sides. Violin starts playing in the background a little.
    * “more…more more …or …love or…craze for people telling me that I’m always more more more…It’s like a disease.”
    * This clock does not have hands
    * Behind me are doors. They are shut. They will not open. None of the doors on the sides are open either. There are just the ones on the left and right on the one in front. The middle one is closed.
    * I entered. I am at a tram station. Upon entering this area, I cannot go back.
    * The trams here are immobile. There is no time. Literally. The clocks have no hands.
    * I cannot fall onto the tracks.
    * This dome is beautiful. There is light everywhere and the windows - they’re lovely. I love the style. The shape. How the trams come and go. They are nice.
    * One door on the tram that is here, is red. It seems to be calling me. I go down the right side of the railroad. I see that there is no track between the two trams. It’s like there is a missing car. The tram is 1017.
        * 1017… epilogue.
    * The destinations are blank too.
    * Tram on the left - 1017
    * I was correct with the red door assumption. It opened as I approached. I have explored the area. I will proceed.
    * I can see down the rows of seats. They all look cozy. They’re all red and nice with wooded handling and they’re cushy too. It looks lovely - perhaps for a long trip.
    * Interestingly the doors do not close as I look around the first cabin.
    * Along the ceiling the sky is blue somehow. I think these are supposed to represent windows, but they could be lights.
    * I proceed into the next car down.
    * …something is off. There should only be two cars that I can proceed to. But there is a third upon the track without rails.
    * “A solution…a solution, solution… “
    * I look out the exit. And I see a home. A nice mansion. There are birds chirping. …hmm. It doesn’t make sense. But there is all i can see explored. I proceed.
    * The doors to the station still do not close. However…when i step off this…
        * …they still do not close. I am teleported to another dimension. there are no rails on this track. There isn’t a track to being with, yet the car is there.
        * But that’s okay.
        * I walk away towards the mansion, backwards. 
    * “I guess if someone had told me ahead of time that he just… really enjoyed making prison games… maybe I wouldn’t’ve thought he was so desperate…? I wouldn’t’ve told so many people that he was depressed. Maybe he just likes making prisons.“
    * I stand in the center of this big circle thing. I assume this would be the place of a fountain.
    * The tram still has yet to go.
    * It has not left yet. I am at the foot of the mansion.
    * The door is open. I walk in and it’s still open.
    * I ascend the marble staircase. The floor is blank, but it is very nice. Same goes for the ceiling.
    * “Even now…the disease is telling me to stop. Don’t show people what a shitty person you are…they’ll hate you”
        * (first time the dialogue cussed)
    * I am presented with a choice between two rooms. One in front and one to my right. I go with the one …on the right first.
    * They both meet in the same room, again. It is okay. Each doorway has two lovely lamps lighting them up.
    * In this room that both of my choices connect, I see cement on the floor, or it could be rock, or stone.
    * There is a blank picture frame in the next room. It has fallen and is within this substance that I am walking on. 
    * Before me, at the end of it, is a door. I see nothing within this door. I examine the painting once more, and proceed into this dark room, walking backwards. The room behind me fades. There is black surrounding me everywhere. 
    * I am taken to a cave. The ceiling is low, looks moist - it’s blue and purple. Lovely. This is …roughly the sort of rock of my happy place.
    * There are these spotlights with no visible light source. I decide to follow them anyway. 
    * I come across a pillar and dialogue:
    * “If I knew that my life depended on something to be driven by other than validation… what would that even be?”
        * it sounds like he’s choking back tears slightly.
    * “heh… it’s strange but… the thought of not being driven by external validation is…unthinkable. Like I actually cannot conceive of what that would be like…
    * These blue prismal-rectangular pillars that extend from the floor to the top (which isn’t very high) seem to be strewn about this way and that. Randomly, almost. Their frequency gets greater as I go forth. 
        * funny…it reminds me of iron island from Pokémon. just the temple place. Just a memory that pops-up. 
    * In the distance I see two white rectangles.
    * It turns out there are about  8 passageways I see at a glance. I wonder…where each one goes.
    * These lights…they stop at one.  It is my turn to choose.
    * Never mind. These all appear to lead to the same place. They are all GIANT blue pillars - each one as valid as the other.
    * But I’m going to choose the one in the middle. I like its shade of blue more. Reminds me of “aura”
        * heheh.
    * The light fades as I approach it to more darkness. There is a purple zig-zagging path that I can see.
    * “What now…”
    * This purple zigzag enters a cave. A funnel, if you will. I shall proceed. It looks…epic.
    * “I … think I need to go. And…I-i’m sorry. I know that I said I would be here and that I would walk you through this but…I’m starting to feel like I have a lot of work to do. I have a lot that I need to make-up for uhh..and…so-on.”
    * “Just…gonna…”
    * “Okay” whispered intensely
    * The lights seem to have flashed.
    * I hear harsh, bellowing winds. 
    * I come to a bend - an open space. It looks fantastic. It looks like things are ripped directly from a dream.
    * I emerge from the cave onto a desert landscape. There are the arches again - but this time they’re more blocky.
    * It is paved. Covered with sandstone.
        * I feel slightly curious to see if the place is still there.
    * To my right in the distance i see a big black box that seems out of place. 
    * I do not need to go through the arches, but I choose to do so anyway.
    * Big sandstone walls open up - and reveal on my right as I approach the distance a ruin of sorts. 
    * These big black…blocky…monolith things. there is a hole when I reach the top of these steps that they are on and in and around. I choose to explore before entering first.
    * I look off the edge and see an endless blue void.
    * I proceed up the steps and peer into this hole
        * Black void again. heh…yolo.
    * I proceed…
    * …and then see that it’s not actually a black void at all and that I was just looking at it wrong lol
    * I hop down.
    * It is a mighty long fall. The floor is rising me up to a doorway. Perhaps I’ll enter.
    * this is like a big elevator. It stops at the door. I enter. To the right I see pillars.
    * Heh, This looks familiar. 
        * I am back in the station…kind of. Could that have represented my dreams? That journey? Perhaps.
    * There is a long stairway. I can hear the birds chirping. They sound nice. 
    * I see a loooong corridor. There are windows now and then. I proceed forward. confident.
    * I look back and admire the world another time, and proceed.
    * The walls get smaller as I go, but that’s ok. 
    * And at last. It is here. The whispering machine.
        * Well done.
        * Its blue beam is bright, beckoning. It’s pretty. I see the energy within it. It is ready. It is my time.
            * I look through the beam one last time
                * Towards my journey that I had… and
                    * I go in.
                        * The electric sound plays, and I rise.
                            * Through it all. all. everything. I see the literal labyrinth in its infiniteness. I see the horizon, the galaxy, the supernova. It is more. 
                                * This is impossible to solve, but it’s always possible to 
                                    * begin.
                                        * To go back and really see what other options i had. To step back and try another path. 
                                            * I hear it- the violin reaches it’s max. It calls. And it all fades to black
        * For R.
* Thanks.

Now…time to finally get “The Stanley Parable” at last! :D
I’ve seen gameplay, but the videos just don’t cut it for me. I wanna see it all…

…after I sleep… because 4am is generally just a tad later than most people stay up.
